# PolySilicon-and-Metal---A-Glimpse-on-MOSFETs-Design-Challenges-thesis
A research report exploring the reasons of changes in MOSFET's gate electrode material as the final research project for both Research Methods and AVLSI course supervised by Prof. Asadollah Shahbahrami and Dr. Mahdi Aminian at the University of Guilan, Department of Computer Engineering, presented in Winter 2024.
# Short Abstract
As MOSFET transistors were introduced, their gate electrodes were made of aluminum. However, in the late 1970s, aluminum was replaced with 
polysilicon. This change was made to reduce the overlap between the source/drain and the gate, and to lower the threshold voltage. For around 40 years, 
polysilicon was the preferred gate material in MOSFETs, but as transistors continued to shrink, several issues emerged. These issues included unwanted 
capacitance between active regions and the gate, velocity saturation and mobility degradation, and gate leakage. Various solutions were developed to 
tackle these problems. Unwanted capacitance between the active regions and the gate was addressed by switching from metal gates to polysilicon. 
Velocity saturation was mitigated using strained silicon. Finally, to deal with gate-channel leakage, the industry saw returning to metal gates as the 
solution. In 2007, Intel led the way by reintroducing metal gates in their 40nm and 45nm processors. They also introduced High-K Metal Gate (HKMG) 
technology in CMOS devices. In this approach, the insulating layer was made from high-k materials instead of polysilicon, and the gate material was 
changed to metal. This research report delves into the reasons for these changes and explores some of the other challenges related to the scaling of 
MOSFETs.
